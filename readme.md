# MovieAPI
>iOS 13.2
>
>Swift 5.0


An app where users can search for movies/shows/eps and save their favorite ones persistently on the phone. 

It fetches its data from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) which is free to use.

## About me 
Hello there!  I'm **Marina** and I'm currently learning iOS Development.  
I built this app in order to practice what I've learned from [@SeanAllen](https://github.com/sallen0400)'s Take Home Project Course .

This app is built 100% programmatically which means *no storyboards* and it also uses *UIKit*.  

### Why am I sharing?
My purpose was and always is to learn and share.  
This app may contain bugs. Well actually...  
This app definitely has some bugs.  
Feel free to use it and hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MarinaAguiar07) if you find some bug lurking around or have any questions.

### Is it finished?

No. I will keep on updating it as soon as I learn more concepts that are applicable.

## What does it use?

* Diffable CollectionView
* Infinite Scrolling -- pagination
* NSCache
* TableView -- with deletion on swipe
* UserDefaults 
* Threads
* JsonDecoder/Encoder
* Custom Views and Alerts
* UIButtons, SFSymbols and GestureRecognizer
* CAGradientLayer
* Dynamic Fonts and Colors -- for accessibility and light/dark mode 
* UIActivityIndicatorView -- loading spinner
* MVC (kinda)
* A lot of escaping closures
